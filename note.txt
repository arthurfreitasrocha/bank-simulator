This is a bank-client simulator that shows the user iteration from the creation of your bank card to the use of that card for purchases at "Casa do Hardware" (which was created for this purpose, to give the "Banco 99" card some usefulness). The Project was created for learning and improvement purposes in C Language, Python and batch files. In addition, it was presented as "Final Work" in the subject of Algorithms and Programming 2 of the Federal University of Jata√≠. Unfortunately, most of the code and all comments are in Portuguese, I apologize for that. I hope these few lines of code can help anyone in need in any way.
